# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Statement

PDF JavaScript Injector is a security-focused tool designed for legitimate professional use. We take security seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection and warnings to ensure responsible usage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

**This tool creates PDFs that execute JavaScript when opened. This functionality can be both beneficial and dangerous depending on usage.**

### Legitimate Use Cases
- Form validation and auto-completion
- Print customization and automation  
- Dynamic content generation
- Accessibility enhancements
- Workflow automation

### Security Risks
- Malicious JavaScript execution in trusted PDF viewers
- Data exfiltration possibilities
- Social engineering attack vectors
- System resource access

## üîç Built-in Security Features

### JavaScript Code Validation
Our tool automatically scans for potentially dangerous patterns:

```javascript
// Dangerous functions we detect and warn about:
- eval()
- Function()
- document.write()
- innerHTML/outerHTML
- Network requests (fetch, XMLHttpRequest)
- File system access attempts
```

### Security Warnings
- **Prominent notices** throughout the interface
- **Risk assessment** for detected dangerous patterns
- **Best practices guidance** for safe usage
- **Disclosure requirements** for distribution

### Safe Defaults
- **No auto-execution** of dangerous examples
- **Clear labeling** of all generated files
- **Validation required** before processing
- **Documentation emphasis** on responsible use

## üéØ Responsible Usage Guidelines

### For Tool Users
- **Understand the code** you're injecting
- **Test thoroughly** in target environments
- **Disclose JavaScript** presence to PDF recipients
- **Use minimal permissions** required for functionality
- **Follow organizational** security policies

### For Developers
- **Review all contributions** for security implications
- **Maintain security warnings** and validation
- **Document security considerations** clearly
- **Test with security mindset**

## üîí Security Measures in Code

### Client-Side Validation
```typescript
// Example security validation
const dangerousFunctions = [
  'eval(',
  'Function(',
  'document.write(',
  'innerHTML',
  'outerHTML'
];

const validateJavaScript = (code: string) => {
  const warnings = [];
  dangerousFunctions.forEach(func => {
    if (code.includes(func)) {
      warnings.push(`Dangerous function detected: ${func}`);
    }
  });
  return { valid: warnings.length === 0, warnings };
};
```

### Warning Systems
- **Real-time validation** as users type
- **Pattern matching** for dangerous constructs
- **Clear explanations** of detected risks
- **Recommendation systems** for safer alternatives
