## üìñ Usage Guide

### Quick Start - Test the Tool

Want to quickly test if the tool works? Use this simple test payload:

```javascript
app.alert('you are hacked');
```

This will display an alert when the PDF is opened, perfect for testing on vulnerable sites or your own PDFs.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Upload PDF Files
- **Drag and drop** PDF files into the upload zone, OR
- Click **"Choose Files"** to select PDFs from your device
- ‚úÖ Multiple files are supported for batch processing

#### Step 2: Write or Select JavaScript Code

**Option A: Use a Quick Test**
```javascript
app.alert('you are hacked');
```

**Option B: Choose from Examples**
- Click the **dropdown menu** to see pre-built examples
- Select any example (auto-print, form validation, etc.)
- The code will automatically populate

**Option C: Write Custom JavaScript**
- Type or paste your JavaScript code in the editor
- Real-time character count shown at bottom
- Click **"Preview Code"** to see your formatted code

#### Step 3: Process Files
- Click **"Inject JavaScript into PDFs"** button
- Watch the real-time progress bar (especially for batch operations)
- See success/error messages for each file

#### Step 4: Download Results
- **Single file**: Click download button next to each processed file
- **Batch download**: Click "Download All" to get a ZIP archive
- All files are prefixed with `js_injected_` for easy identification
- A processing summary text file is included in batch downloads

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Important Warnings
- **Potentially Dangerous**: This tool can create PDFs that execute code when opened
- **Use Responsibly**: Only inject JavaScript code you trust and understand
- **Disclosure Required**: Always inform recipients about embedded JavaScript
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality in target PDF viewers

### Risk Mitigation
- Code validation helps identify potentially dangerous functions
- Security warnings alert users to risks
- Example library provides safe, tested code snippets
- Documentation emphasizes responsible usage

## üîß Technical Implementation

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. **File Reading**: Convert uploaded PDFs to ArrayBuffer
2. **PDF Parsing**: Use PDF-lib to load and parse PDF structure
3. **JavaScript Injection**: Add code as document open action
4. **PDF Generation**: Save modified PDF with embedded JavaScript
5. **Download Preparation**: Create downloadable blob with proper MIME type

### JavaScript Validation
- Syntax checking for basic errors
- Pattern matching for dangerous functions
- Network activity detection
- File system access warnings

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- File API and ArrayBuffer support required
- Blob download functionality needed

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Client-side Processing**: No server uploads required
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing for large files
- **Batch Optimized**: Parallel processing with progress tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**JavaScript not executing in PDF?**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your PDF viewer (Adobe Acrobat/Reader)
- Check if the PDF viewer shows security warnings - you may need to allow the script
- Test with the simple payload: `app.alert('you are hacked');`

**Upload not working?**
- Check file format - must be valid PDF files
- Try a smaller PDF file first
- Ensure your browser supports modern JavaScript (File API)

**Need Help?**
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Check existing documentation
- Review security guidelines before use
- Contact: Ahmi (Security Researcher)
