- File system access alerts

### Security Warnings
- Clear documentation of risks and legitimate uses
- Prominent security notices throughout the interface
- Best practices guidance for safe usage

## üéØ Use Cases

### Legitimate Applications
- **Form Validation**: Add client-side validation to PDF forms
- **Auto-printing**: Configure PDFs to print automatically when opened
- **Dynamic Content**: Generate timestamps, user info, or calculated fields
- **Accessibility**: Enhance PDFs with screen reader support
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamline document processing workflows

### Example JavaScript Functions
```javascript
// Simple alert when PDF opens
app.alert("Welcome! This PDF contains embedded JavaScript.", 3);

// Auto-print functionality
this.print({
  bUI: false,
  bSilent: true,
  bShrinkToFit: true
});

// Form field validation
var nameField = this.getField("name");
if (nameField && nameField.value === "") {
  app.alert("Please enter your name.", 1);
  nameField.setFocus();
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Important Warnings
- **Potentially Dangerous**: This tool can create PDFs that execute code when opened
- **Use Responsibly**: Only inject JavaScript code you trust and understand
- **Disclosure Required**: Always inform recipients about embedded JavaScript
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality in target PDF viewers

### Risk Mitigation
- Code validation helps identify potentially dangerous functions
- Security warnings alert users to risks
- Example library provides safe, tested code snippets
- Documentation emphasizes responsible usage

## üîß Technical Implementation

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. **File Reading**: Convert uploaded PDFs to ArrayBuffer
2. **PDF Parsing**: Use PDF-lib to load and parse PDF structure
3. **JavaScript Injection**: Add code as document open action
4. **PDF Generation**: Save modified PDF with embedded JavaScript
5. **Download Preparation**: Create downloadable blob with proper MIME type

### JavaScript Validation
- Syntax checking for basic errors
- Pattern matching for dangerous functions
- Network activity detection
- File system access warnings

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- File API and ArrayBuffer support required
- Blob download functionality needed

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Client-side Processing**: No server uploads required
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing for large files
- **Batch Optimized**: Parallel processing with progress tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
